@{
    Layout = "_Layout2";
}

@* 
    IF we don't add details of where layout located it will try to take it from 1 of 2 places:
    /View/[ControllerName]/....
    /Views/Shared/...
    
    BUT if in both places we have file with same name(like _Layout2)
    file from [ControllerName] will have more priority and will be applied
